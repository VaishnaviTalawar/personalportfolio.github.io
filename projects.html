            <h2>Traffic light controller</h2>
            <h3>We have used the verilog programming language for creating this mini project. </h3>
            <p>A Verilog source code for a traffic light controller on FPGA is presented. A sensor on the farm is to detect if there are any vehicles and change the traffic light to allow the vehicles to cross the highway. Otherwise, highway light is always green since it has higher priority than the farm. </p>
